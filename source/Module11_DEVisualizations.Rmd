# Summarizing DE results

Part of differential expression analysis is generating visualizations and summary tables to share our results. While the DESeq2 vignette provides [examples of other visualizations](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#exploring-and-exporting-results), a common visualization to summarize DE comparisons are [volcano plots](http://resources.qiagenbioinformatics.com/manuals/clcgenomicsworkbench/752/index.php?manual=Volcano_plots_inspecting_result_statistical_analysis.html).

## Tabular DE summary

To generate a general summary of the DE results, we can use the `summary` function to generate a basic summary by DESeq2.

```{r DESeq2Summary}
summary(results_deficient_vs_control)
```

However, this summary is simply a text output that we are unable to manipulate. Moreover, notice that the thresholds are not quite as we would like them.

To create our own summary, we first need to choose thresholds. A standard threshold for the adjusted p-value is less than 0.05. A reasonable threshold for linear fold-change is less than -1.5 or greater than 1.5 (which corresponds to log2 fold-change -0.585 and 0.585, respectively). Including a fold-change threshold ensures that the DE genes have a reasonable effect size as well as statistical significance.

Let's set these thresholds as variables to reuse. This is generally good practice because if you want to change those thresholds later then you only have to change them in one location of your script, which is faster and can reduce the risk of errors from missing some instances in your code.

```{r PlotSetup1}
fc = 1.5
fdr = 0.05
```

Additionally, there is a [Dalmon et al 2012](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-S2-S11) paper about p-value and fold-change thresholds for microarray data that may help provide some context.

If we think back to Computational Foundations, conditional statements could allow us to determine the number of genes that pass our thresholds, which would be useful for annotating our results tables and plots.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Here is one possible answer:

```{r StatSigGenes2}
sum(results_deficient_vs_control$padj < fdr & abs(results_deficient_vs_control$log2FoldChange) >= log2(fc), na.rm = TRUE)
```

**Checkpoint**: *If you see the same number of DE ganes with our choosen thresholds, please indicate with a green check. Otherwise use a red x.*

</details>
<br>

Let's now create a new column in `results_deficient_vs_control` to record the significance "call" based on these thresholds. And let's separate the call by "Up" or "Down", noting that these are relative to our "Case" condition. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the following will work:

First define all values as "NS" or "not significant":

```{r NSColumn}
results_deficient_vs_control$call = 'NS'
head(results_deficient_vs_control)
```

Next, determine the "Up" and "Down" indices:

```{r UpDownIndices}
up_idx = results_deficient_vs_control$padj < fdr & results_deficient_vs_control$log2FoldChange > log2(fc)
down_idx = results_deficient_vs_control$padj < fdr & results_deficient_vs_control$log2FoldChange < -log2(fc)
```

Last, use those indices to assign the correct "Up" or "Down" values to the correct indices, and look at the head of the result:

```{r CallColumn}
results_deficient_vs_control$call[up_idx] = 'Up'
results_deficient_vs_control$call[down_idx] = 'Down'
head(results_deficient_vs_control)
```

Finally, since plotting functions often require categorical groupings, let's make this `call` column a factor and specify the level ordering:

```{r FactorCall}
results_deficient_vs_control$call = factor(results_deficient_vs_control$call, levels = c('Up', 'Down', 'NS'))
head(results_deficient_vs_control)
```

> # Tip {.unlisted .unnumbered}
> It is often helpful to include code like this in differential expression analyses so there is a clearly labelled column that makes subsetting and summarizing the results easier.

Now we are in a position to quickly summarize our differential expression results:

```{r TableCall}
table(results_deficient_vs_control$call)
```

We see quickly how many genes were "Up" in iron replete, how many were "Down" in iron replete, and how many were not significant.

**Checkpoint**: *If you successfully added the `call` column and got the same table result as above, please indicate with a green check. Otherwise use a red x.*

## Visual DE summary

As described by the [Galaxy project](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot/tutorial.html), a volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (adjusted p-value) versus effect size (fold change). In a volcano plot, the most upregulated genes are towards the right, the most downregulated genes are towards the left, and the most statistically significant genes are towards the top.

Let's coerce the `DataFrame` which was returned by `DESeq2::results()` into a `tibble` in anticipation of using the `ggplot2` library to plot. We're also going to modify our results table so that the row names become a separate column, and so that it's ordered by adjusted p-value.

```{r PlotSetup2}
# Use the rownames argument to create a new column of gene IDs
# Also arrange by adjusted p-value
results_forPlot = as_tibble(results_deficient_vs_control, rownames = 'id') %>% arrange(padj)
```

Let's start with a very simple volcano plot that plots the `log2FoldChange` on the x-axis, and `-log10(padj)` on the y-axis.

```{r VolcanoPlot}
# Initialize the plot, specifying the plot type as 'geom_point'
ggplot(results_forPlot, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj))) +
  geom_point()
```

This is a good start, but it's good practice to add better labels to the plot with the `labs()` function:

```{r VolcanoPlot2}
# Add plot labels and change the theme - save the plot as object `p`
p = ggplot(results_forPlot, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj))) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(
        title = 'Volcano Plot',
        subtitle = 'control vs deficient',
        x = 'log2 fold-change',
        y = '-log10 FDR'
    )
p
```

What if we now added some visual guides to indicate where the significant genes are? We can use the `geom_vline()` and `geom_hline()` functions to accomplish this:

```{r VolcanoPlot3}
# Add threshold lines
p1 = p +
    geom_vline(
        xintercept = c(0, -log2(fc), log2(fc)),
        linetype = c(1, 2, 2)) +
    geom_hline(
        yintercept = -log10(fdr),
        linetype = 2)
p1
```

Finally, why not color the points by their significance status? We already created the `call` column that has the correct values. In this case we can get away with adding `geom_point()` to our existing plot and specifying the correct aesthetic:

```{r VolcanoPlot4}
p2 = p1 + geom_point(aes(color = call))
p2
```

Finally, we can adjust our plot to have a nicer color scheme:
```{r}
p3 = p2 + scale_color_manual(name = '', values=c('#B31B21',  '#1465AC', 'darkgray'))
p3
```

For additional visualizations for our DE results, we included some example code in the [Bonus Content module](https://umich-brcf-bioinf.github.io/2023-03-13-umich-rnaseq-demystified/html/R_bonus_content.html) and this [HBC tutorial](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/06_DGE_visualizing_results.html) also includes some nice examples.

### Subsetting significant genes

You may be interested in creating a table of only the genes that pass your significance thresholds. A useful way to do this is to conditionally subset your results. Again, we already created the `call` column, which makes this relatively simple to do.

*Note: The tidyverse functions you learned in Software Carpentry could also be alternatively used here.*

```{r ConditionalSubset}
# tidyr (requires table reformatting)
res_sig <- as_tibble(results_deficient_vs_control, rownames = "gene_ids") %>% filter(call != 'NS')

# base
res_sig <- results_deficient_vs_control[results_deficient_vs_control$call != 'NS', ]

head(res_sig)
dim(res_sig)
```
