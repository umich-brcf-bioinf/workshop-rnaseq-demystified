# Summarizing DE results

Part of differential expression analysis is generating visualizations and summary tables to share our results. While the DESeq2 vignette provides [examples of other visualizations](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#exploring-and-exporting-results), a common visualization to summarize DE comparisons are [volcano plots](http://resources.qiagenbioinformatics.com/manuals/clcgenomicsworkbench/752/index.php?manual=Volcano_plots_inspecting_result_statistical_analysis.html).

## Tabular DE summary

To create our own summary, we first need to choose thresholds. A standard threshold for the adjusted p-value is less than 0.05. A reasonable threshold for linear fold-change is less than -1.5 or greater than 1.5 (which corresponds to log2 fold-change -0.585 and 0.585, respectively). Including a fold-change threshold ensures that the DE genes have a reasonable effect size as well as statistical significance.

Let's set these thresholds as variables to reuse. This is generally good practice because if you want to change those thresholds later then you only have to change them in one location of your script, which is faster and can reduce the risk of errors from missing some instances in your code.

```{r PlotSetup1}
fc = 1.5
fdr = 0.05
```

Additionally, there is a [Dalmon et al 2012](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-S2-S11) paper about p-value and fold-change thresholds for microarray data that may help provide some context.

If we think back to Computational Foundations, conditional statements could allow us to determine the number of genes that pass our thresholds, which would be useful for annotating our results tables and plots.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Here is one possible answer:

```{r StatSigGenes2}
sum(results_deficient_vs_control$padj < fdr & abs(results_deficient_vs_control$log2FoldChange) >= log2(fc), na.rm = TRUE)
```

**Checkpoint**: *If you see the same number of DE genes with our choosen thresholds, please indicate with a green check. Otherwise use a red x.*

</details>
<br>

Let's now create a new column in `results_deficient_vs_control` to record the significance "call" based on these thresholds. And let's separate the call by "Up" or "Down", noting that these are relative to our "Case" condition. There are many ways to accomplish this, but the following will work: <!-- modify to tidyverse syntax & move "base" options to dropdown menu -->


```{r DEColumn}
# create new column called "call"
results_deficient_vs_control$call = 'NS'
head(results_deficient_vs_control)

# determine the "Up" and "Down" indices:
up_idx = results_deficient_vs_control$padj < fdr & results_deficient_vs_control$log2FoldChange > log2(fc)
down_idx = results_deficient_vs_control$padj < fdr & results_deficient_vs_control$log2FoldChange < -log2(fc)

# use indices to assign the correct "Up" or "Down" values to the correct indices, and look at the head of the result:
results_deficient_vs_control$call[up_idx] = 'Up'
results_deficient_vs_control$call[down_idx] = 'Down'
head(results_deficient_vs_control)

# modify column to be factor  to make for easier plotting
results_deficient_vs_control$call = factor(results_deficient_vs_control$call, levels = c('Up', 'Down', 'NS'))
head(results_deficient_vs_control)
```

> # Tip {.unlisted .unnumbered}
> It is often helpful to include code like this in differential expression analyses so there is a clearly labelled column that makes subsetting and summarizing the results easier.

Now we are in a position to quickly summarize our differential expression results:

```{r TableCall}
# check summary of results
table(results_deficient_vs_control$call)
```

We see quickly how many genes were "Up" in iron replete, how many were "Down" in iron replete, and how many were not significant.

**Checkpoint**: *If you successfully added the `call` column and got the same table result as above, please indicate with a green check. Otherwise use a red x.*

## Visual DE summary

As described by the [Galaxy project](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot/tutorial.html), a volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (adjusted p-value) versus effect size (fold change). In a volcano plot, the most upregulated genes are towards the right, the most downregulated genes are towards the left, and the most statistically significant genes are towards the top.

Let's coerce the `DataFrame` which was returned by `DESeq2::results()` into a `tibble` in anticipation of using the `ggplot2` library to plot. We're also going to modify our results table so that the row names become a separate column, and so that it's ordered by adjusted p-value.

```{r PlotSetup2}
# Use the rownames argument to create a new column of gene IDs
# Also arrange by adjusted p-value
results_forPlot = as_tibble(results_deficient_vs_control, rownames = 'id') %>% arrange(padj)
```

Let's start with a simple volcano plot that plots the `log2FoldChange` on the x-axis, and `-log10(padj)` on the y-axis, adding custom labels to the plot with the `labs()` function:

```{r VolcanoPlot2}
# Add plot labels and change the theme - save the plot as object `p`
p = ggplot(results_forPlot, aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj))) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(
        title = 'Volcano Plot',
        subtitle = 'control vs deficient',
        x = 'log2 fold-change',
        y = '-log10 FDR'
    )
p
```

What if we now added some visual guides to indicate where the significant genes are? We can use the `geom_vline()` and `geom_hline()` functions to accomplish this:

```{r VolcanoPlot3}
# Add threshold lines
p1 = p +
    geom_vline(
        xintercept = c(0, -log2(fc), log2(fc)),
        linetype = c(1, 2, 2)) +
    geom_hline(
        yintercept = -log10(fdr),
        linetype = 2)
p1
```

Finally, why not color the points by their significance status? We already created the `call` column that has the correct values. In this case we can get away with adding `geom_point()` to our existing plot and specifying the correct aesthetic, before customizing to have a nicer color scheme:

```{r VolcanoPlot4}
# map color to the `call` column from our input data
p2 = p1 + geom_point(aes(color = call))
p2

# adjust our color scheme
p3 = p2 + scale_color_manual(name = '', values=c('#B31B21',  '#1465AC', 'darkgray'))
p3
```

For additional visualizations for our DE results, we included some example code in the [Bonus Content module](https://umich-brcf-bioinf.github.io/2023-03-13-umich-rnaseq-demystified/html/R_bonus_content.html) and this [HBC tutorial](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/06_DGE_visualizing_results.html) also includes some nice examples.


### Adding gene symbols to our data

What if we wanted to include labels for some of the most up and/or down regulated genes from our comparisons? We can do this by using external information that maps the ENSEMBL ids from our reference files/count tables to corresponding gene symbols. We've provided a table with these mappings but in the next module, we'll show how to access resources and generate this kind of mapping table. 

```{r GeneKey, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
id_mapping = read.table("../data/R_data/ENSEMBL_id_mappings.csv",
                       sep = ",",
                       header = TRUE)
```

```{r GeneKey2, eval = FALSE}
# read in table mapping ENSEMBL ids to gene symbols
id_mapping = read.table("data/ENSEMBL_id_mappings.csv",
                       sep = ",",
                       header = TRUE)
head(id_mapping)
```

We want to match the `id` column of `results_deficient_vs_control` to the `ensembl_gene_id` column of `id_mapping`, and once that match is found, we want to extract the `external_gene_name` column of `id_mapping` to get the gene symbol. Next, look at the documentation for `dplyr::left_join()` and merge the `id_mapping` table into the `results_deficient_vs_control` table on the columns `ensembl_gene_id` and `external_gene_name`.
```{r left_join}
# check our starting data
head(results_deficient_vs_control)

# use `join` to add gene symbols to row with matching ENSEMBL id
results_deficient_vs_control_annotated = as_tibble(results_deficient_vs_control, rownames = "id") %>%
    left_join(id_mapping, by = c('id' = 'ensembl_gene_id'))
head(results_deficient_vs_control_annotated)
```

We can use some of the `tidyverse` functions we've encountered previously to rename the `external_gene_name` column to `symbol` and to move it into the second column position? Hint: Because of the order of the packages we may have loaded, we'll use `dplyr::rename()` and `dplyr::select()` instead of just the `select()` function. We can discuss this in a moment.

```{r rename_rearrange}
# use dplyr functions to rename columns and reorganize table to make more readable
results_deficient_vs_control_annotated = results_deficient_vs_control_annotated %>%
  dplyr::rename('symbol' = 'external_gene_name') %>%
  dplyr::select(id, symbol, everything())
head(results_deficient_vs_control_annotated)
```

And now we have our differential expression results annotated with gene symbols, which can help in the interpretation of the results, and can be used in downstream analysis such as functional analysis. Although we don't have time to run this together, we can also use this table to label genes of interest in our volcano plot.

> Now that we annotated our DE results to add gene symbols, what steps would we take to add labels to our volcano plots for the top differentially expressed genes in our comparison?
