## Aligning All Samples Exercise

<br>

**15 Minutes**

<br>

We just learned about how to use RSEM & STAR, but now we need to align all of the rest of our samples to the reference genome. In this breakout exercise, we'll build upon some concepts we've learned previously.

<br>

### Instructions:

<br>

- Work independently in the main room, posting any questions that arise to slack.
- Recommendations for writing your own code:
  - Read function documentation
  - Test out ideas - it's okay to make mistakes and generate errors
  - Use a search engine to look up errors or recommended solutions using keywords
- We'll review possible solutions after time is up as a group.

<br>

- Review what we've learned about running RSEM + STAR, to determine an appropriate command for aligning our samples.
- Using what we've learned previously, create a script using this command to quickly and easily align the rest of our samples.
- Run the script, view the output, and verify that we have the files we need.
