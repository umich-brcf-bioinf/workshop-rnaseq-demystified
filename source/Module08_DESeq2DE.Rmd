# Count normalizations

Since counts of mapped reads for each gene is proportional to the expression of RNA in addition to many “uninteresting” other factors, normalization is the process of scaling raw count values to account for the “uninteresting” factors and ensure expression levels are more comparable.

## Normalization goals

Two common factors that need to be accounted for during normalization are **sequencing depth** and **gene length**. Common normalization approaches (such as FPKM, RPKM, CPM, TPM, etc.) account for one or both of these factors.

* **Sequencing depth** normalization is necessary to account for the proportion of reads per gene expected for more deeply sequenced samples (like in pink below) versus a less deeply sequenced sample (like in green below).

![*Note that each pink or green rectangle represents an aligned read, with reads spanning an intron connected by a dashed line. Figure from [HBC  training materials](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/02_DGE_count_normalization.html)*](./images/normalization_methods_depth.png){width=75%}

* **Gene length** normalization may also be necessary if comparing between different genes, since genes of different lengths have different probabilities of generating fragments that end up in the library.

> **Note**: The above figure was originally from a [HBC  tutorial](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/lessons/02_DGE_count_normalization.html) that also includes a detailed comparison of different normalization (CPM, TPM, FPKM) approaches and their best uses.

**Check-in: Questions about normalizations?**

## DESeq2 normalizations

DESeq2 has an [internal normalization process](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106) that accounts for **RNA composition**. A few highly differentially expressed genes, differences in the number of genes expressed between samples, or contamination are not accounted for by depth or gene length normalization methods. Accounting for RNA composition is particularly important for differential expression analyses, regardless of the tool used.

For data exploration and visualizations, it is helpful to generate an object of independently normalized counts. We will use the [rlog transformation](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#count-data-transformations) from DESeq2 that accounts for sequencing depth for each sample and RNA composition for the downstream quality control visualizations.

The rlog transformation produces log2 scaled data that has also been normalized to overall library size as well as variance across genes at different mean expression levels. For larger numbers of samples, there is an alternative transformation method, [vst](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#count-data-transformations) that can be used instead for count normalizations.

The command to generate the normalized count object has a few parts, including `dds` as an input and providing a value to the option `blind`. For our purposes, we set `blind = TRUE` because we want to compare samples in downstream QC plots in an unbiased manner.

```{r CountNorm}
rld = rlog(dds_filtered, blind = TRUE)
```

Next, we'll look at the results of the transformation by extracting the values with the `assay()` function.

```{r CountNormCheck}
head(assay(rld), 2)
```

Looking at the rld values, we can see that they are now in log scale. Since we set `blind=TRUE`, the transformation is blind to the sample information we specified in the design formula. The normalized counts are helpful for visualization methods during expression-level quality assessment but **aren't used in the model fitting**.

We'll come back to these normalized data, but first let's write out both the raw and normalized count tables to file.

### Output count tables

To output the raw counts, we will need to use the `counts` function to access the count table from within its larger `DESeqDataSet` object.

```{r OutputCountsRaw, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(counts(dds, normalized = FALSE), file="outputs/tables/DESeq2_raw_counts.csv")
```

Then we'll output the rlog count table, using the `assay` function to access the normalized count table from within its larger `DESeqDataSet` object.

```{r OutputCountsRlog, eval = FALSE}
write.csv(assay(rld), file="outputs/tables/DESeq2_rlog_normalized_counts.csv")
```
