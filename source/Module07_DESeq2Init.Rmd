# Sample Information

As introduced at the beginning of the workshop, we have downloaded and prepared data from an existing publication [(Zhang et al., 2019)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/46976), wherein one goal is to understand the gene expression differences in wild-type mice that that were "iron replete" and fed a control diet (we label these "control") and "iron deficient" (we label these "deficient").

![](images/Module00_top_down.jpg)

## Read Sample Table

Our next step will be to describe the samples within our R session, so that we make the proper comparisons with DESeq2. Let's check the sample names from the count table.

```{r ColumnNames}
colnames(count_table)
```

Based on the sample names that are the columns of `count_table`, our samples are blinded, e.g. the sample names don't clearly correspond to treatment groups. We will need to specify which sample IDs connect to which experimental conditions.

Typically sample phenotype data, including experimental conditions, are stored as Excel or CSV files that we can read into R, and then use when creating a DESeq2 object. If you are unfamilar with CSV files or how to generate them, there are [tutorials](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-CSV-File) available to guide you through the process.

> # Tip: Sample naming conventions {.unlisted .unnumbered}
> Use only alpha-numeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), and separate parts of the name with underscores (`_`) or dots (`.`). Do not begin sample names with numbers.

We'll load our 'pre-made' sample information sheet, `samplesheet.csv`, to unblind our samples.

```{r Samplesheet, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
samplesheet = read.table("../data/R_data/samplesheet.csv",
                       sep = ",",
                       header = TRUE,
                       row.names = 1)
```

```{r Samplesheet2, eval = FALSE}
samplesheet = read.table("data/samplesheet.csv",
                       sep = ",",
                       header = TRUE,
                       row.names = 1)
```

Alternatively, we can manually create a sample sheet.
```{r Samplesheet3, eval=FALSE}


```

We can look at the object by typing its name and hitting Enter. Note, for larger experiments, you may want to use `head()`.

```{r ShowSamplesheet}
samplesheet
```

**Checkpoint**: *If you have loaded `samplesheet`, please indicate with the green 'check' button. Otherwise, please use the red 'x' button to have the command repeated*


In this example data, all mice are wild-type and the control diet mice are labeled as "control" and the iron deficient diet fed mice are labeled as "deficient". Again, for larger experiments, you may want to examine the coding of the samples by looking at the `unique()` values of the relevant columns.

```{r TreatmentGroupTable}
unique(samplesheet$condition)
```


### Replicates and sequencing depth in RNA-seq experiments

> **Question** In this experiment, we only have samples from three mice per each condition. Do we have enough replicates?

The goal of our analysis is to separate the “interesting” biological contributions from the “uninteresting” technical or other contributions that either cannot be or were not controlled in the experimental design. The more sources of variation, such as samples coming from heterogenous tissues or experiments with incomplete knockdowns, the more replicates (>3) are recommended.

![Image of technical, biological, and experimental contributors to gene expression, from HBC training materials](images/de_variation.png){width=75%}

For a more in depth discussion of experimental design considerations, particularly for the number of replicates, please read [A Beginner’s Guide to Analysis of RNA Sequencing Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6096346/) or papers like this one by [Hart et al](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842884/) that focus on estimating statistical power for RNA-seq experiments.


### Sample table formatting

Next, we'll format our table so that we have the appropriate data type (an ordered [factor](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors/)) for DESeq2 to recognize our treatment groups and appropriately compare samples.

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Consider copying sample sheet & updating/mutating condition column to be a factor
```

```{r SamplesheetFactor}
# tidy version
samplesheet_ready <- samplesheet %>% mutate(condition = factor(condition, 
                                          levels = c('control', 'deficient')))

# base version
samplesheet_ready <- samplesheet
samplesheet_ready$condition = factor(samplesheet_ready$condition,
                            levels = c('control', 'deficient'))

unique(samplesheet_ready$condition)
```

Notice that we set the levels in a particular order. This is important for setting the "Control" (or "Reference") group as the denominator in the default comparisons when we setup our DESeq2 model.

Before we proceed, we need to make sure that the sample labels (column names) in the count table match the sample information table (row names), including the order. If the sample labels don't match, then we will see an error and need to correct the labels prior to proceeding. Checking the sample information table is extremely important to ensure that the correct samples are grouped together for comparisons.

```{r CheckSamplesheet}
all(colnames(count_table) == rownames(samplesheet_ready))
```
This line of code checks if both the identity and order match between our `count_table` and our `samplesheet`. If, in the course of using your own data, this returns `FALSE`, try using the `match()` function to rearrange the columns of `count_table` (or the rows of `samplesheet`) to get them to match.

**Checkpoint**: *If you your sample info check returns `TRUE`, please indicate with the green 'yes' button. Otherwise, please use the red 'x' button to have the command repeated*

# Creating DESeq2 object

Bioconductor software packages often define and use custom structures to store data in a way that suits biological data, such as illustrated below from [Huber et al. 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3252).

![A breakdown of the SummarizedExperiment class.](./images/SummarizedExperiment.jpg)

These custom data structures have pre-defined data slots, which hold specific types/classes of data and therefore can be more easily accessed by functions from the same package.

To create the DESeqDataSet we need two important inputs:

1. A table that assigns the condition labels for each sample (that we read in and formatted)
1. A *raw* count matrix

Is our count matrix from our RSEM outputs considered a "raw" count matrix by DESeq2?

> # Exercise: RSEM outputs versus DESeq2 input requirements {.unlisted .unnumbered}
>
> If we think back to the RSEM outputs, the 'expected_counts' table may include fractional amounts due to how the alignment tool resolves reads mapping to multiple locuses). DESeq2 is expecting the count matrix to consist only of whole numbers. Recent versions of DESeq2 will handle this for us, but previous versions did not.
>
> What R function, that we saw in Computational Foundations, could we use to convert the fractional values in `count_table` to integers?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

We can use the `round()` function:

```{r round count_table}
counts_rounded = round(count_table)
```
</details>
<br>

To create the `DESeqDataSet` we will need the `count_table` and the `samplesheet`. We will also need a **design formula** to specify our model.

## Making model choices

The design formula specified informs many of the DESeq2 functions how to treat the samples in the analysis, specifically which column(s) in the sample metadata table are relevant to the experimental design.

In this case, we aren't aware of any [covariates](https://methods-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/reference/encyc-of-research-design/n85.xml) that should be considered in our comparisons. However, if there are additional attributes of the samples that may impact the DE comparisons, like date of collection, sex, or patient of origin, these should be added as [additional columns](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/75309/) in the sample information table and [added to a design formula](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/98700/).

More complex questions, including adding "interaction terms" between multiple group labels are helpfully described in [this support thread](https://support.bioconductor.org/p/98628/) as well as in the [DESeq2 vignette](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#interactions), which is an excellent document.

The design formula specifies the column(s) in the metadata table and how they should be used in the analysis. For our dataset we only have one column we are interested in, that is `condition`. This column has two factor levels, which tells DESeq2 that for each gene we want to evaluate gene expression change with respect to these different levels.

```{r DESeq2Object}
## Create DESeq object, line by line
dds = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts_rounded,
                              colData = samplesheet_ready,
                              design = ~ condition)
dds
```

Notice that printing the `dds` object helpfully shows us some helpful information:

* The dimension (number of genes by number of samples),
* The gene identifiers,
* The sample identifiers,
* The additional column names giving information about the samples

**Checkpoint**: *If you see `dds` in your environment panel, please indicate with the green 'check' button. Otherwise, please use  use the red 'x' button in your zoom reaction panel to have this step repeated. You can use the red 'x' to be put in a breakout room for help*

# Pre-filtering

While not necessary, [pre-filtering](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#pre-filtering) the count table helps to not only reduce the size of the DESeq2 object, but also gives you a sense of how many genes were reasonably measured at the sequencing depth generated for your samples.

Here we will filter out any genes that have less than 10 counts across any of the samples. This is a fairly standard level of filtering, but can filter data less/more depending on quality control metrics from alignments and sequencing depth or total number of samples.

```{r PreFilter}
keep = rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds_filtered = dds[keep,]
dds_filtered
```

Notice the `dds_filtered` object has less elements than the unfiltered `dds` object, indicating that a number of genes were not measured in our experiment.

**Checkpoint**: *Questions?*

<details>
    <summary>*Click for how to model batch effects with DESeq2*</summary>

    Differences between samples can also be due to technical reasons, such as collection on different days or different sequencing runs. Differences between samples that are not due to biological factors as called **batch effects**. We can include batch effects in our design model in the same way as covariates, as long as the technical groups do not overlap, or **confound**, the biological treatment groups.

    Let's try add some additional meta-data information where we have counfounding batch effects and create another DESeq2 object.

```{r Confounders}
samplesheet_batch = samplesheet_ready
samplesheet_batch$batch = factor(c(rep(c("Day1", "Day2", "Day3"), 2)), 
                                 levels = c("Day1", "Day2", "Day3"))

dds_batch = DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts_rounded,
                      colData = samplesheet_batch,
                      design = ~ batch + condition)
```
</details>

# Summary

In this section, we:

* Loaded the necessary input files into our R session
* Discussed model design for DESeq2
* Initialized a DESeq2 data set
* Filtered our count data

Now that we've created our DESeq2 objects, including specifying what model is appropriate for our data, and filtered our data, we can proceed with assessing the impact of the experimental conditions on gene expression for our samples.
